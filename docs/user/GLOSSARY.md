- **Task Chunking**: Breaking down large tasks into manageable pieces while maintaining context and quality.

### Model Management
- **Model Orchestration**: The system responsible for coordinating multiple AI models, managing their execution, and routing tasks appropriately.
- **Quality-First Approach**: Design philosophy prioritizing output quality over processing speed, achieved through dedicated resource allocation.
- **Model Queue**: Organized system for managing multiple model requests while ensuring optimal resource utilization.

### State Management
- **State Preservation**: Complex system for maintaining context, decisions, and progress across multiple sessions and interactions.
- **Context Management**: Handling and preserving the contextual information necessary for consistent model operation.
- **Memory System**: Infrastructure for managing both short-term (active session) and long-term (project history) information.

### Performance Terms
- **Latency**: Time between request submission and response delivery.
- **Throughput**: Amount of tasks processed in a given time period.
- **Quality Metrics**: Measurements used to assess the quality of model outputs and system performance.

### Development Concepts
