## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/insane-bolt.git
    cd insane-bolt
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
    ```

3. **Configure `.env` files for each machine**:
    - Create a `.env` file for each machine using the provided `.env.example` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Access the application**:
    - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
    - Review system status and resource utilization via the dashboard.
